# Test Plan Structure & Responsibilities (Email Summary)

    Hello,

    I'm Jessica, a senior software tester here at Four Walls Software. I understand you're writing a test plan for the Landfill Labs project. I'm sorry to say we don't have a proper template yet, but you should use this structure to be compliant with our approach:

    1.	Introduction
    2.	Test Objectives
    3.	Scope of Testing
        3.1 In-Scope
        3.2 Out-of-Scope
    4.	Test Criteria
        4.1 Entry Criteria
        4.2 Exit Criteria
    5.	Test Environment
    6.	Resource Allocation
    7.	Test Data Requirements
    8.	Test Schedule
    9.	Testing Strategy
        9.1 Unit Testing
        9.2 Integration Testing
        9.3 System Testing
        9.4 User Acceptance Testing
    10.	Testing Tools
    11.	Test Deliverables
    12.	Test Responsibilities
    13.	Risks and Assumptions
    14.	Approvals
    15.	Appendices

    Under the test responsibilities section you should put yourself as the Lead Tester. If you feel like you'll need additional resource, you should assign some responsibilities to the wider team: Me (Senior Software Tester), Alice (Software Tester), Bob (Software Tester).

    Look forward to meeting you at the next Four Walls away day!

    Thanks,
    Jessica
