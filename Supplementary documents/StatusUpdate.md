# Status Update (Email Summary)    
    
    Hi,

    I’m the Software Developer that will be working with you on Landfill Labs project. I’m sure you’ve already received an overview of the project, but I wanted to provide you with an update of current progress.

	After meeting with the client, it became clear that they wanted the tool to take the form of a RESTful Web Service in the first instance. They’re thinking the user interface is a separate piece of work. I’ll send you some diagrams for the architecture shortly, the senior team helped me put them together. Additionally, I’ll forward you a summary of the MoU/scope and a requirements specification.

    Looking forward to working together on this project!

    Kind regards,
    Sam
